		Python launcher for Unix.

		Providing a convenient way to launch python üêç

		py is meant to become your go-to command for launching a python interpreter
		while writing code.

		It does this by trying to find the python interpreter that you most likely
		want to use by looking in a few different places:

		1) Passed version as an argument
		2) An activated virtual environment
		3) A virtual environment in the current or parent directories
		4) The shebang of the target file (if relevant)
		5) The latest version of python on $PATH

		If py reaches the end of the list without finding a valid interpreter,
		it will exit with an error message.
		`),
		Example: heredoc.Doc(`
		
		# Launch the latest version of python on $PATH (or a virtual environment)
		$ py

		# Launch the latest python3 on $PATH
		$ py 3

		# Launch a specific version on $PATH
		$ py 3.10

		# List all found interpreters
		$ py list
